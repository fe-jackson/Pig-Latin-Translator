PROJECT TITLE: Pig Latin Translator

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To translate English text into Pig Latin. This includes words 
with apostrophes in them. (If an apostrophe is sandwiched between at least two 
letters, the program will consider it part of the word. If there's something other
than a letter directly on either side of the apostrophe, the program registers it 
as seperate from all of the words near it.)

INSTRUCTIONS: Run the main function in the ReadAndTranslate class. You can pass a 
String with a text file name to main so it knows to translate that file, or you 
can start the program without passing any Strings and the program will prompt you 
to give it text to translate. 

After each translation, the program will ask you if you want to translate anything 
else. If you type "yes", it'll ask you to type the text that you want to translate. 
If you type "no", then the program will end.
