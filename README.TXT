PROJECT TITLE: Pig Latin Translator

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This program translates English text into Pig Latin, including 
words with apostrophes in them. If an apostrophe is directly adjacent to two letters 
(one on each side), then the program will consider it to be a part of a word. If it
isn't, then the program consides the apostrophe to be seperate from all of the words 
near it.

INSTRUCTIONS: 
     Compile the program and run the ReadAndTranslate class. You can pass a String 
with a text file name to main so it knows to translate that file, or you can start the 
program without passing any Strings to itand the program will prompt you to give it 
text to translate. 
     After each translation, the program will ask you if you want to translate 
anything else. If you type "yes", it'll ask you to type the text that you want to 
translate. If you type "no", then the program will end.
